<h2 id="overview">üìñ Overview</h2>

A game is comprised of stacked states, responsible for their own behaviours, rendering and lifecycle. All the states exist in a single stack which is processed on every animation frame.

Game state is managed by manipulating the `stack`; A first in, last out data structure.

Below is a short example flow.

| Step                                                                                               | Stack                                          | State            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Stack is initialised.                                                                              | `[]`                                           | `null`           |
| `StartState` is pushed onto the stack to start the game.                                           | `[StartState]`                                 | `StartState`     |
| `OverworldState` is pushed onto the stack.                                                         | `[StartState, OverworldState]`                 | `OverworldState` |
| An in-game battle occurs and `BattleState` is pushed onto the stack.                               | `[StartState, OverworldState, BattleState]`    | `BattleState`    |
| The battle ends and the stack is popped.                                                           | `[StartState, OverworldState]`                 | `OverworldState` |
| The player opens their inventory menu to heal themselves. `InventoryState` is pushed to the stack. | `[StartState, OverworldState, InventoryState]` | `InventoryState` |

<h2 id="game-states">üß© Game States</h2>

Game states provide frame by frame functionality for your game.

### Creating States

Create a new state class, implementing the `State` interface and defining at least one handler method.

```ts
export class MyGameState implements State {
  enter(): void {
    console.log('Pushed to the stack!');
  }

  exit(): void {
    console.log('Popped from the stack!');
  }
}
```

They may implement a number of handler methods as described below.

### üîÑ Lifecycle Methods

A game state can implement the following optional lifecycle methods, called by the `stack`.

| Method                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enter(): void`                               | Called when this state is pushed to the stack, before its first `update`.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `update(frame: Frame): void`                  | Called with each invoke of `requestAnimationFrame` by the `game`. `Frame` data is provided which includes a current timestamp as well as a delta time. `update` is only called on the state that is at the top of the stack. |
| `render(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D): void` | Called after each `update` on the same frame. Provides the canvas rendering context as an argument.                                                                                                                          |
| `exit(): void`                                | Called when this state is popped off the stack.                                                                                                                                                                              |

### üéÆ Input Handling

If your state is interested in mouse and keyboard events, implement the following methods.

| Method                                 | Description        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `keyup(event: KeyboardEvent): void`    | Key up event.      |
| `keydown(event: KeyboardEvent): void`  | Key down event.    |
| `keypress(event: KeyboardEvent): void` | Key press event.   |
| `mouseup(event: MouseEvent): void`     | Mouse up event.    |
| `mousedown(event: MouseEvent): void`   | Mouse down event.  |
| `mouseenter(event: MouseEvent): void`  | Mouse enter event. |
| `mouseleave(event: MouseEvent): void`  | Mouse leave event. |
| `mouseout(event: MouseEvent): void`    | Mouse out event.   |
| `mouseover(event: MouseEvent): void`   | Mouse over event.  |
| `mousemove(event: MouseEvent): void`   | Mouse move event.  |

### Using States

To advance your game to the next state, simply `push` an instance of your state to the game stack.

```ts
// Import the `game` object.
import game from '@game';

// Elsewhere in your code
game.stack.push(new MyGameState());
```

States can also be popped from the stack as long as it has states to `pop`.

```ts
// Remove top-most state
game.stack.pop();
```
